# Why Should a DBA Use Incerto? The Database Co-Pilot That Actually Works

> "The best database co-pilot isn't the one that can chat with your database—it's the one that can think like your best DBA, learn from mistakes, and solve problems before they become incidents."

If you're still manually writing repetitive SQL/No-SQL queries, time to analyze data is days or spending nights on production fires, you're missing out on what modern AI can do for your database operations.

## Unprecedented Accuracy Without Training

### 86% Accuracy on Complex Data Without Any Ontology

Most AI database tools require extensive training, custom ontologies, or domain-specific knowledge to work effectively. Incerto is different. You might feel 86% is low (we are chasing 100% too), check out the dataset it was operating on [Conglomerate Dataset](https://github.com/TextQLLabs/conglomerate-benchmark/tree/main/v1/lite). It has 109 tables, with similar data stored in several tables. Can you answer 18 questions with 100% accuracy? Our whole team wouldn't be able to (without incerto). 

>We achieved 86% accuracy on a 109-table conglomerate database without any prior ontology or informed knowledge.

This speaks for how good LLMs work with right framework and prompting.

How does this translate to impact?

- **Sales teams** can get customer insights in minutes, not hours
- **Operations teams** can identify performance bottlenecks before they impact users
- **BI teams** can generate complex reports without waiting for DBA availability

### Grounding by default 
We don't create a semantic layer, or do typical RAG pipelines. Incerto acts on realtime tables, which store data. Over time learning which tables are important and what kind of data they store. We are mimicking what an efficient DBA would do (hence Co-Pilot). 

You will see SQL queries it is running, and the analysis it is making. You can stop and change the direction any time you want.

## Empowering You to Be 10x Faster

### The Right Context Makes All the Difference

>A typical DBA doesn't handle one instance of database, but a cluster. They don't work with one DBMS but several.

Incerto supports working across different DBMS and their specific context through *DBMS Specific Context* and multi host execution through same chat.

Anything you find important you can store it as a template and tag it with '@' in chat.

We track some necessary contexts like:

- **Real-time performance monitoring** all production impacting insights are accessible through `@firing`
- **Current operations** all the operations taking time are accessible by typing `@operations`
- **Tables and Columns** You can just `@<start_typing_table_name>` and it will send columns and metadata about table to LLM
- **Natural language query understanding** no SQL queries but just what you want to get done.

## Solving Production Bugs That Stump Senior DBAs
Incerto has solved many production bugs from detection to fixing -- without any manual SQL queries

### The PostgreSQL CPU Spike Mystery

The exact problem and process of solving can be found here: [Auto-Healing PostgreSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjlLU8RXbBA)
> "This bug would have taken our senior DBA team days to solve. Incerto identified and fixed it in under 15 minutes." — Database Engineering Lead

## Friction to Adopt

We know DBeaver, SQLBench are dear and amazing software. There are lots of features they have which Incerto doesn't match, but who says we will be writing SQL queries for long? We are not trying to replace them, but augment the AI + Database experience. 

Our team is trying hard to make it as seamless as possible to try out and extract value from. But there will be friction and some effort to try new product, we encourage you to take that step. Contact our team for any assistance.
