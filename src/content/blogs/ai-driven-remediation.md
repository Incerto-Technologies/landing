# AI-Driven Remediation: How Incerto Delivers Faster Incident Response

> Downtime is expensive and stressful—every extra minute your team spends chasing a problem costs money, customers, and sanity. 

Let's see how Incerto can help you resolve incidents faster using AI.

## The Problem: Data Overload, Signal Lost

> A great DBA in your team doesn't *just* have great problem solving abilities, but also has a deep understanding of your database, its configuration, and its environment. 

Primary problem AI based remediation approaches face is that they have too many possibilities to choose from and not enough context to make a informed decision.

## Incerto’s Approach: Context-First

Incerto provides AI agents with exactly what they need to know and helps them work together in harmony to resolve incidents.

**How it works:**

Incerto connects to your Databases and instantly captures a rich set of signals including:

- 100+ deep metrics and insights per database (replication metrics, performance metrics, health metrics, configuration state, etc.)
- Resource utilization patterns (CPU, memory, I/O, disk utilization, etc.) 
- Schema changes and their impact on query plans
- Incerto's knowledge base of learnings, best practices, historical data, and pre-configured entities.
- Deployment information (version, configuration, OS, kubernetes, docker, etc.)
- Among others.

We use state-of-the-art techniques to divide and orchestrate the work between agents to provide a novel approach to Incident Remediation.

## Real Outcomes: Shorter Incidents, Fewer Pages

Teams using Incerto have seen their incident response time **drop by 75%**. 

RCA becomes a breeze, and on-call pages drop dramatically.

| Metric | Before | After |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Mean Time to Resolve | 60 min | 15 min |
| Root cause ID time | ~30 min | <2 sec |
| On-call pages/week | 12 | 2 |
| Storage cost (scale) | baseline | 90% lower |

## Is my data secure? How hard is it to set up?

Incerto runs **on-prem**, so your data stays yours. (More details in the next blog!)

Super easy to set up (< 30 min), Insights and responses flow wherever your team works (Slack, teams, etc.).

## Summary

**Incerto is the best context-engine for your database**—making every alert, every query, and every investigation faster, clearer, and more useful for your team.

Give your engineers the tools to focus on what matters, not midnight firefighting. If that sounds interesting, let’s connect—your weekends will thank you.
