# Incerto vs MCP Servers - Why Chat Isn't Enough for Database Management

While MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers enable AI to interact with databases through chat, they miss what makes a true database co-pilot effective. Let's explore why.

## Typical Database Problem Scenario

Let's say we wanted to see if all 20 databases are doing fine or not. How do you see that with MCP Server + Chat UI? It will be lot of text, lists or tables. How do you take the action of problematic databases? Can you click "Solve all problem" button which automatically slaps all needed context in a Chat UI? No you will ask question "what is wrong" -- again blob of text. This repeats until you give up or it finds the answer and give 3 options, out of which you don't know what to choose. 

Now above scenario can look better for MCP if they have lot of custom tools -- how many such tools exists? Most just give "text to sql". 

Let's do simple point-wise discussion instead of biased rant.

## The Visual Understanding Gap

Do you think the graphs which we see can be summarized as quickly in text? Do you want to see diff of code/SQL like how github shows or blob of text explaining how they are different?

> "The human brain processes visual information 60,000 times faster than text."

Even the smartest editor can't show the above in text + graphs + tables better than the visual.

## Pay for basics 

Do you want to pay every time you render a the graph or text? For every small task? How much cost would grafana dashboard like visualization take?

In a Co-Pilot built for database you will get the graph made without any tokens, but you will be able to control what you see through right sql query.

## Surface area for errors

AI is non-deterministic and it can make mistakes. So do you want to render graph for you every time? Would it be same every time? It has intelligence (some form of it) but it doesn't have perfection or any guarantee. We want system which will reduce the use of intelligence where it required not sprinkle it everywhere. To make those smart decision you will have to choose a custom and tailored AI Co-Pilot for Databases.

## Right Context 

To get some task right done, you need to inform the AI as well as possible and also not give irrelevant information. Context must be complete yet concise. But DBMSes have so much context TBs of data, 100s of queries running, lot of problems and errors firing, niche production problems. How will you give that context? We will have to build a really sophisticated engine and the expose that as MCP server, but who is doing it? What you find in market is "text to sql" wrapped up, or maybe some specific deterministic way of optimizing (which is not general enough to apply on all databases). 

Here too we need visual aid, and human touch in choosing the right context. And Humans as established above comprehend and understand right visual cues 60000x faster than blob of text.

## Production ready and Secure

Do you want to setup MCP servers from unknown companies on Cursor and let it run on Production? Have you tried running more than 3 MCP server which are similar on cursor?

Production has lot's of nuances, security being one of the top most. Incerto has lot of production crucial features like: 
- Parallel tool calls
- Multi host and inter DBMS tasks support. You can copy a table from all PostgreSQL and move it to MySQL
- Deterministic, low latency production issue checks and alerts (with 1 click solutions)
- Your data never leaks, completely on your infra. Air gapped. 
- 99.9999% uptime
- In production since January 2025

## Incerto or MCP servers?

Once you use Incerto, you will never ask again!
