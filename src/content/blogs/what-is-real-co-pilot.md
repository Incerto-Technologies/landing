# What is a Real Database Co-Pilot?

Let's understand what we should expect from the best AI-powered Co-Pilot for databases. And where does Incerto stands today.

## The Best of Humans Can't Be Replaced by Incerto (Yet)

If you have a responsible, smart, extremely knowledgeable teamate managing your databases, Incerto is not a replacement for them yet.
They bring **context** and **agency** - qualities that are hard to replicate.

> Otherwise, we would call it a "Pilot" instead of a "Co-Pilot."

## The Limitations of Being Human

Despite their strengths, humans have certain limitations:

- You can't track everything happening inside a database.
- Writing SQL queries takes time.
- You can't store all the context needed to solve complex issues.
- You can't master every DBMS your organization uses.

## What's the Hardest Part About DBMS in Production?

**Context Overload.** Most organizations use 3-4 different DBMSs simultaneously, each running distinct workloads. The larger the scale, the more context is needed, and the more people are required to manage it.

> "A real Co-Pilot must maintain all context, across DBMSs."

## DBMS Expertise is Rare

Becoming an expert requires hands-on experience solving real production issues. That's why many teams rely on external vendors with deep domain expertise.

> "A real Co-Pilot must be able to solve any production issue, across DBMSs."

## Intelligence is Required to Optimize and Solve Unknown Problems

We can all agree on this:

> "A real Co-Pilot must be able to optimize and solve unknown problems."

## What Does Incerto do?

> "Incerto has the ability to fetch complete context across multiple DBMSs and use AI agents to solve problems and complete tasks."

At its core, Incerto is a **Context Engine built specifically for databases**.
