# System Architecture

Our platform is built on a modern, scalable architecture designed for high performance and reliability.

## Overview

The architecture consists of several key components that work together to provide a seamless experience:

The above diagram shows how data flows through our system from ingestion to analysis and alerting.

## Key Components

### Data Ingestion Layer
- Real-time data streaming
- Batch processing capabilities
- Multiple data source connectors

### Processing Engine
- Advanced analytics algorithms
- Machine learning pipelines
- Custom query processing

### Storage Layer
- Distributed data storage
- High-availability configuration
- Automated backup and recovery

## Smart Context Engine

Our intelligent context engine processes and correlates data across multiple dimensions:

This engine enables:
- Automatic pattern recognition
- Contextual anomaly detection
- Intelligent root cause analysis

## Agent Loop System

The core of our AI-powered analysis is the agent hypothesis loop:

This system continuously:
1. Generates hypotheses about potential issues
2. Tests those hypotheses against real data
3. Refines understanding based on results
4. Takes corrective actions when needed

## Real-time Monitoring

Our monitoring dashboard provides comprehensive visibility:

Features include:
- Real-time metrics visualization
- Custom alerting rules
- Historical trend analysis
- Interactive drill-down capabilities

## Integration Points

The system supports multiple integration patterns for seamless connectivity with your existing infrastructure.
